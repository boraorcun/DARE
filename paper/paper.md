# Summary

The forces on stars, galaxies, and dark matter under external gravitational
fields lead to the dynamical evolution of structures in the universe. The orbits
of these bodies are therefore key to understanding the formation, history, and
future state of galaxies. The field of "galactic dynamics," which aims to model
the gravitating components of galaxies to study their structure and evolution,
is now well-established, commonly taught, and frequently used in astronomy.
Aside from toy problems and demonstrations, the majority of problems require
efficient numerical tools, many of which require the same base code (e.g., for
performing numerical orbit integration).

# Statement of need

Although there are numerous low-fidelity design and analysis studies aimed at accurately characterizing the performance specifications of ramjet engines, most focus on individual components of the propulsion system rather than a comprehensive methodology. Few studies consider the combined influence of flight conditions and design parameters throughout the entire propulsive flow path. Therefore, this study integrates individual design and analysis approaches for high-speed propulsion components to develop a holistic, low-fidelity design method for cost-efficient characterization of the ramjet engine design space. Accordingly, `RASDAS` is developed.
